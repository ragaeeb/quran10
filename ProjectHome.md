This app facilitates the reading of Qu'ran for Muslims using BlackBerry® 10 to get a smooth and fluid native experience. It includes translations in several languages (Bengali, English, French, Indonesian, Malaysian, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, and many more) as well as the original Arabic version. There is also support for verse-by-verse recitation to help you memorize the Qu'ran. You have several reciters to choose from.

There is built-in support for bookmarking a verse and a surah to quickly pick up where you left off reading. There is also easy access to copying certain verses to make it easy for you to share it with your contacts.

While reading the chapters you can easily show a split-pane view to show the tafsir (Ibn Katheer's explanation) to understand the interpretation of the verse according to the companions of the Prophet (sallahu alayhi wa'sallam).

Finally, there is built-in support to do efficient and fast lookups for any surah or any text in the surah in any of the languages. Note that the search will only be done on the translation that you are currently on.
